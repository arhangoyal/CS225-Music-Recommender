# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
 </br>The team has decided to meet twice every week in-person or in Zoom for 1-2 hours, preferably on Thursday or Friday. There will be a record keeper that notes down the high-level discussion points. The team will keep cycling this position starting with Arhan this week.

2. **Assistance** 
</br>Assistance can be asked for on Discord, and someone should respond as soon as possible. The assistance can come in the form of a text discussion on Discord or a meeting between team members.

3. **Respect** 
</br>To ensure that everyone gets the chance to express their ideas, in meetings only one person will speak at a time. The rest of the group should pay attention to the speaker, and everyone should avoid distractions during all team meetings. Overall, team members should act respectfully towards one another.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
</br>Everyone will have a roughly equal amount of work. If a team member encounters an issue, they should first try to resolve it on their own. If they are unable to, then they are welcome to ask for help on Discord, as outlined under the Assistance section. Any complications or unforeseen work will be discussed as a team.

5. **Time Commitment** 
</br>In order to finish the project in a timely manner, each team member will be expected to work at least three hours a week. Each time conflict or other delaying event will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis in order to determine how the missing time will be made up, if it can be safely ignored, etc.

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
</br>In the event of a conflict, the whole team should meet and discuss the issue at the earliest possible time in order to resolve the situation as quickly and effectively as possible. In the event that this meeting fails to resolve the issue, then the course staff may be contacted about the problem.
