# Development Logs

## Development Log (Date: 10/28/22 -- 11/04/22)

### Weekly Goals
1. We wanted to meet twice and have a final project idea ready. We **completed** the task.
2. We wanted to choose the dataset to use for our project. We **completed** the task.
3. We wanted to create a rough list of things to do with our dataset. We **completed** the task.
4. We wanted to complete our team contract. We **completed** the task.
5. Submit all deliverables on PrairieLearn. We **completed** the task.
6. Documented a starter list of algorithms we can use for our project. We **completed** the task.

### Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
1. Brainstormed project idea and detailed what we wanted to do with our dataset (Sara, Arhan, Amitabh, Alex): We will essentially treat subreddit hyperlink data as a social network. Given the Stanford subreddit data graph, we perform a BFS traversal of the graph in order to find the shortest distance of hyperlinks between each subreddit. We then take the 5 closest subreddits based on hyperlink distance and print them out. The shorter the hyperlink distance, the more related two subreddits are. We also want to figure out if popularity correlates with number of links leading to the subreddit.
2. Found dataset to use (Alex): [Link to Reddit Hyperlinks Dataset](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-RedditHyperlinks.html)
3. Created GitHub repository and shared it with team of 4 and our mentor (Arhan): [Link to repository](https://github.com/arhangoyal/CS225-Music-Recommender) has been created. The only thing left is sharing it with Sara, who will share her GitHub username later tonight since she is on the road.
4. Complete team contract (Amitabh): submitted on PrairieLearn.
5. Submit all deliverables on PrairieLearn (Arhan).
6. Documented a starter list of algorithms we can use for our project (Sara): PageRank, Djikstra's, &c. We have an initial list ready but will select the final one next week.
7. Submit an initial project proposal. All aspects could be subject to change depending on whether or not an optimization was discovered. (Alex, Amitabh, Arhan)

### Problems Encountered 
1. We did not encounter any problems except hearing each other since we met online for our meeting today (Friday). The noise at Grainger IDEA Lab was tough to hear over.

### Plans for next week
1. Decide algorithm to use: PageRank or Djikstra's algorithm
2. Start building out step 1 of project (basic grouping of subreddits), OR
3. Create shortest path algorithm (perhaps Djikstra's Algorithm?)

### Optional: Questions for mentor
1. Are there any optimizations you could think of?
2. What exactly does Eulerian walk/Cycle detection mean?

## Development Log (Date: 11/04/22 - 11/11/22)

### Weekly Goals
- We decided to plan which algorithm to use between Dijkstra's and PageRank. We were able to meet the goal.
- We decided to start structuring over our development and haven't been able to do so. We plan to meet on Saturday (12 Nov, 22) and meet the goal.
- We decided to start creating a file parser & preprocessor and haven't been able to do so. We plan to meet on Saturday (12 Nov, 22) and meet the goal.

### Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
- Arhan and Sara have collectively decided how to revise our initial proposal for a successful regrade.
- Alex and Amitabh have collectively started conceptualizing the file parsers and algorithms to be developed soon.

### Problems Encountered 
- Majority members had crucial exams, for which we had to postpone our meet (11 Nov, 2022).

### Plans for next week
- Get the file parser and preprocessor running
- Get done with the BFS algorithm

### Optional: Questions for mentor
- We have a few question and will be reaching out directly via e-mail.
